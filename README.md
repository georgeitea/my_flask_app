If you connected from the GDRemoteHub website link then you will need to download app.py and its two folders (static and templates).
After downloading them you will need to open a folder and put everything you downloaded before inside.(All these files are located in the folder named python_app2. It contains all the files needed by the project.)


Unfortunately, you can't make your phone a server. The only function that phones have is the controller function that you can download from your phone. The python file is called adroid_app.py and you can take the code from this file and put it in Pydroid 3 and press execute.(For the program to work properly, Pydroid 3 must have the sockets library and kivy.)



If you have any problems with the placement, you can contact me on Instagram. Send me a message on this account:(https://www.instagram.com/george_daradimos_?igsh=aGpjeHA5Z3NwMXZi) :)
