If you connected from the GDRemoteHub website link then you will need to download app.py and its two folders (static and templates).
After downloading them you will need to open a folder and put everything you downloaded before inside.


If you have any problems with the placement, you can contact me on Instagram. Send me a message on this account:(https://www.instagram.com/george_daradimos_?igsh=aGpjeHA5Z3NwMXZi) :)
